The Multiplicative Environment Manager
--------------------------------------

 - Inspired by virtualenvwrapper.
 - Language-agnostic, at least as an ideal.
 - I've lately come across a few projects with similar goals, concepts, and/or ideas:
    - [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv).  (Don't overlook [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv).)
